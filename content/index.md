### About me
I am a physicist with a strong foundation in mathematics. My interests lie in applications of abstract mathematics in the physical world. I am looking to broaden my experience and knowledge in different areas of mathematics, e.g., topology and geometry. My inclination is towards the mathematical foundations of Quantum Field Theories. However, I am also passionate about more practical topics like Topological and Geometrical Data Analysis applied in biology, e.g., neuroscience.

I started a garden project where I published several parts of my notes on different topics. If you are interested in consulting them, you can find them [[Garden|here]].
