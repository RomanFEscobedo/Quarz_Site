### About me

I am an MSc. in Mathematics student at TU Munich. Nonetheless, I have a BSc. in Physics. Thus, my interests lie in the practical applications of abstract mathematics in the physical world. I am looking to broaden my experience and knowledge in different areas of mathematics, e.g., topology, geometry, and algebra. My inclination is towards the mathematical foundations of Quantum Field Theories. 

However, I am also passionate about more practical topics like Topological and Geometrical Data Analysis applied in biology, e.g., neuroscience, which can inspire new research directions.
